# Flappy Bird AI

This an AI adaptation of the classic flappy bird game built with processingJS library. Credit to the Coding train Youtube channel for the tutorial on how to build this game and the nueral network.

This was my first neural network project and though by no mean is it an optimised AI to play flappy bird I was able to see noticable improvement over 500 generations.
